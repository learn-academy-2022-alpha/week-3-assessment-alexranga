# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
  `this` keyword points to a particular object. One should understand first where a function is invoked because we don't know what is in the `this` keyword until that function is invoked.

  Researched answer:
  The `this` keyword enables developers to reuse functions in different execution contexts. This means that a function once defined, can be invoked for different objects using the `this` keyword. It is also used in identifying the object in the current execution context when we invoke a method.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: 
  React is a JavaScript library for creating user interface(s) and allows developers to create reusable components.

  Researched answer:
  React is a JavaScript library that combines the speed of JavaScript and uses a new way of rendering webpages, making them highly dynamic and responsive to user input. It is component based, which means that we use it to build many small parts, and then join them together to form entire applications. 



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: 
  I have came across React component lifecycles - mounting, updating, unmounting and that's pretty much what I have - when a component is placed,  updated, and removed into or from the DOM.

  Researched answer: 
  Render is a React class component lifecycle method as it runs automatically anytime the view updates.



4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: 
  JS as javaScript and X as "ex"tension to incorportate the JS to React.

  Researched answer: 
  React JSX is an extension to JavaScript and it enables developers to create virtual DOM using XML syntax. Simply, it allows one to directly write HTML in React (within JavaScript code).)



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: 
  A yarn is a package management solution for developers.

  Researched answer: 
  Yarn is a JavaScript package manager that creates the file structure of a React app and manages the dependencies.



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: 
  The meaning of the word 'anonymous' defines something that is unknown or has no identity. Since it's associated to a type of a function, I can say that it's a function without a name or identifier.

  Researched answer: 
  Anonymous Function is a function that does not have any name associated with it. It is not accessible after its initial creation, it can only be accessed by a variable it is stored in as a function as a value. An anonymous function can also have multiple arguments, but only one expression.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: conditional rendering refers to the process of delivering elements and components based on certain conditions.

2. Props: Props (properties) is a keyword in React for passing information from one component to another

3. JavaScript Events: It is the change in the state of an object.

4. Object-oriented programming: it refers to languages that uses objects in programming and aims to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function. 

5. Ruby: Ruby is a general-purpose, interpreted, dynamically-typed, server-side scripting language.
